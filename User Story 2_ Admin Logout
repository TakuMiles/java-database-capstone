**Title: Adimin**

As an admin, I want to log out of the portal so that I can ensure no unauthorized user accesses the system after me.

Acceptance Criteria:

The admin can click a “Logout” button to end the session.

The system invalidates the current session token.

The admin is redirected to the login page after logout.

Priority: High
Story Points: 2
Notes:

Session timeout should also trigger automatic logout for inactivity.
