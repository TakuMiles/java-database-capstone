**Title: Admin**
As an admin, I want to run a stored procedure in MySQL to get monthly appointment statistics so that I can track platform usage and doctor activity.

Acceptance Criteria:

The admin can execute a predefined stored procedure from the MySQL CLI or admin panel.

The procedure returns the total number of appointments per month.

Results are displayed or exported in a readable format (e.g., CSV or table).

Priority: Medium
Story Points: 5
Notes:

Consider automating this process for dashboard reporting in future iterations.
